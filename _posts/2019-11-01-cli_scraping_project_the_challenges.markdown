My first project was a rough one. I knew what I wanted to create, but I had no idea where to start. Thanks to Beth's videos it helped me understand what I was doing and where to start. She did a great job at describing what she was doing and the "whys" behind all of it. 

For my project I wanted to focus on outdoor gear but as we might know, to buy great gear it is  normally more expensive. Whenever I buy gear I go straight to the "sales" page and I pick the "top rated" because I know that 1. the clothes will be cheaper and 2. people have actually put reviews on the website about the product which tells me what I may or may not like.

Starting out this project I felt like I knew nothing, I felt like everything that I learned went through one ear and out the next. I knew that I must have learned something because I finished the assignments so that is when I decided to not just jump into my project, but to take a step back and review what I had learned. 

I re-read all of the readings and re-watched all of the videos and took detailed notes in a notebook. I also met with my instructor a few times to go over the "whys" because while reviewing things on my own I realized that I was saying "It is just the way it is, but I have no idea why". I am glad that I took this assignment at a slower pace because I was able to understand what I didn't know before. Going back and reviewing everything was tough because it made me feel like I was failing. It made me feel like I should have known this before, but I don't actually know it. 

Ego: I really had to throw away my ego and be okay with saying/asking "I don't know", "can you explain that again", "I am confused", "huh??". My instructor did a great job and explaining things, breaking it down and being patient. I also leaned on other students who knew what they were doing and this also gave them to practice what they knew. 

Another tough thing is, wondering where you stand with your peers.  It is natural to want to know if your classmates are struggling also because you don't want to be alone. When I started to come forward that I was struggling,two others came forward and admitted the same thing.  A common question that I would ask my instructor was "Are other people asking this? Am I the only one?" For me, I just wanted the reassurance that I wasn't alone and lo and behold, I wasn't

This project was a great learning and it was fun to see what I had learned come together. 

Do I enjoy scraping? Nope! 
Do I think it is neat? Yes!
Am I happy I am doing this? 100%, bring it on!
