Objects and instances are more or less interchangeable . But why can't we just say object or instance? There is more to it. An object is a container of thing that you are creating. 


I know that an example that we bring up is Fido who is a dog. Fido is the object.

Objects are pretty much everything, some examples are classes, arrays, instances and strings.
