Getting stuck is the  most  frustrating thing and it is also tough because you don't know what you don't know.

The biggest things that have helped me are;
 
- Ask questions and don't feel stupid
- Figure out your learning style > youtube videos, walk throughs, talking about it, reading about it
- Look into Udemy, they do a great break down of what is going on
- Take a break > eat, sleep, nap, workout. Do what makes you happy. 

My biggest struggle was and still is, I don't know what I don't know. I think I know things until I get asked a question and then I realize how much I don't know.
