The reason why I wanted to learn how to code started when I took a trip to Taiwan. My brother who is a computer programmer was sitting with me at a cafe and asked the big question "Do you like your job?". Right away all I could think was no because I feel like I am doing nothing all day and it isn't mentally stimulating.

During that trip I started to look into coding to see if it was something that I really enjoyed and before the Taiwan trip, I created a basic website that was CSS and HTML. I heard that javascript and the rest of the coding languaged were very hard and you just had to push through it.

I knew that I enjoyed CSS and HTML but could I do that other languages? That is when I did a mini coding prep bootcamp for 5 weeks to see if this was something that I wanted to do. After those 5 weeks I loved how every night I was drained, my mind was racing and I even dreamt the code that I was creating. I haven't felt that kind of challenge since college and it has been something I have been craving ever since.

I know that learning this stuff will be tough, but it will be worth it. I want flexbility, constistancy and mentally stimulating job. I want to be proud of what I have created and getting into coding will never be a disadvantage, it will only advance my career.
