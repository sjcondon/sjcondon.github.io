This is one project I will use the word "hate". I was too caught up in my head, was confused, fixed too much and then had to redue a lot of stuff. 

Three months ago (March 2020), I should have been done with my project but I 1. had a lot of confusion with the project and 2. COVID hit and I spent all month worried I would lose my job. Mid-March I decided I should change cohorts since I felt stress to the max and the couldn't handle it anymore. I am thankful I took a break because in April, I lost my job due to COVID and my new job became landscaping during the day and job hunting/networking in the evening. It gave me time to focus on getting a job and surviving instead of living by a thread. Now it is June, I feel more confident in what I am doing, I got hired at another company that was better than my last and I can now focus on being successful. 

This break was a MUST. COVID, job loss, re-hire and riots. Crazy last couple of months. I was able to understand what Rails does but I also had to relearn since I took a large break from everything.
