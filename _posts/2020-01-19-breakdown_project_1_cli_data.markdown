Whenever I go on a website, I like to look at the top rated, sales items.

Going through that website you can lookup multiple things including;

Gender : Women and Men
Product Catagories: Pants, tops, sales, etc.
Product details : color, size, description, top rated, etc

For my project I decided to name my CLI gem: prana and focus on womens sale items that are the top rated since that is what I normally look at on my own right away.

With that, I had enough information to get my project started.

Starting out I ran,  *bundle gem*

This created a skeleton for my project
