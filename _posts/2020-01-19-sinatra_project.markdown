This was a fun project to do but VERY tedious. 

Struggles: 
- I forgot to "git commit -m" and because of this I had to add everything at the end. 
- I had mono for pretty much this entire section so it was hard to keep up with. 
- I came across errors constantly because I forgot little things like putting an "s" or leaving it out.
- A lot of the exercises, I got errors, which caused me to doubt myself and make me feel like I didn't know what I was doing.


What really helped me with this project was watching Aly's video and if it wasn't for that I wouldn't have known where to start. It was a lot of watching and almost doing a "code along". After this project, I learned that I have to be better at focusing and focusing on the details. I learned that I LOVE more front end development because I enjoy seeing the results and changes happen right in front of me. HTML and CSS: I thought that I knew quite a bit of it and I learned that I knew barely nothing. It was fun to use both HTML and CSS, bootstraps is a game changer!

I created my project so that Personal Trainers could keep track of information on their clients. When I was a PT, I found this rather difficult because everything I did was with paper and I had no way of keeping of clients when a PT left. I would love to add more to this project when I have more time/ when we have a break.
